# Diamond Dynamics – Price Prediction & Market Segmentation

An end-to-end Machine Learning and Deep Learning project to predict diamond prices and segment diamonds into meaningful market categories.  
The project is deployed using a Streamlit web application.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Diamond pricing depends on several quality attributes such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions.  
This project solves two key business problems:

- Predicting diamond prices accurately
- Segmenting diamonds into market groups for better pricing and inventory decisions

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build multiple regression models for price prediction
- Build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model
- Perform market segmentation using K-Means clustering
- Visualize clusters using PCA
- Deploy predictions using a Streamlit web app

## 📊 Dataset Information

| Property | Value |
|--------|------|
| Dataset | Diamonds Dataset |
| Rows | 53,940 |
| Columns | 10 |

### Main Columns

| Column | Description |
|------|-------------|
| carat | Weight of the diamond |
| cut | Cut quality (Fair → Ideal) |
| color | Color grade (D best → J worst) |
| clarity | Inclusion quality |
| x, y, z | Dimensions in mm |
| price | Price in USD (converted to INR) |

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Removed invalid values (0 in x, y, z)
- Handled missing values
- Converted price from USD to INR
- Removed outliers using IQR method
- Checked skewness of numerical features

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Price distribution plots
- Carat vs price relationship
- Price vs cut, color, clarity
- Correlation heatmap
- Scatter plots and boxplots

---

## 🧩 Feature Engineering

Derived new features to improve model performance:

- Volume = x × y × z
- Price per Carat
- Dimension Ratio
- Carat Category (Light / Medium / Heavy)

---

## 🎯 Feature Selection

- Used Random Forest feature importance
- Selected the most influential features for modeling

---

## 🤖 Regression Models

The following models were trained and evaluated:

- Linear Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor (Best Model)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- XGBoost Regressor  
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)  

**Evaluation Metrics Used**
